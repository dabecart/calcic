# calcic

*Written by @dabecart, 2026*

A basic C compiler written in Python. Compiles to x86-64 architecture, but this was written to 
develop a custom processor called **CALCIC** with its own set of instructions (work still in progress).

Based on the great book *Writing a C compiler* by [Nora Sandler](https://norasandler.com/).

Tested against [writing-a-c-compiler-tests](https://github.com/nlsandler/writing-a-c-compiler-tests) and [calcic-tests](https://github.com/dabecart/calcic-tests) repositories.

See its usage by running:

```
./calcic --help
```

Tested and developed with `Python 3.12.3`.
